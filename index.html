					● Set up Circle-CI continuous integration flows for two applications, included Dockerizing both services, coverage reporting with Jenkins, and writing Bash scripts to trigger integration checkpoints. Streamlining the production deploy process and taking the burden of deploying off the Infrastructure team.<br/>
